 üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @BigLiese, you can also find me in LinkdeIn: *https://www.linkedin.com/in/cong-lu/* or  reach me here: *1300455270@qq.com*

### About me

## üëÄ Working Experience

This is my **second year being an Front-end Developer** in South China.After becoming a front-end engineer, I have completed several projects and read numerous algorithm books, blogs, and courses. However, the more I learn, the more I realize how much there is to know and how much I still have to learn. Ergo my principle and goal are to persist in learning and finding more **concise and efficient ways to write code**.

In my previous positions, I have honed my skills in JavaScript, Typescript, Vue.js, and SCSS. I am also experienced in testing and debugging code to ensure high-quality deliverables. 

## üíûÔ∏è My Interests

I have a natural affinity and passion for **learning different languages**. After achieving fluency in *English*, I taught myself *Spanish, Japanese, and German*. I also enjoy exploring different cultures through music, reading original works, watching movies and TV shows, and even tuning in to stand-up. The collision of cultures and ideas never fails to fascinate and entertain me.

I also have a great passion for outdoor sports and activities. On weekends, in addition to exploring and learning on my own, I enjoy **going hiking, camping, and playing outdoor badminton** with my friends. It's a perfect way to recharge my energy while having fun and connecting with nature.

Without a doubt, I take every opportunity to travel. I have already **visited more than 20 provinces and over 40 cities in China**. Fortunately, through a job opportunity, I have also had the chance to explore beautiful cities in **the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand**, as well as memorable places like  **Tahiti and Bora Bora**.I even had the chance to experience **my first skydiving and scuba diving in Hawaii**, which were both exhilarating and unforgettable. In my future plans, I hope to visit even more countries and cities, to experience different landscapes and cultures.
